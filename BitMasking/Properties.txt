1. a+b = a^b + 2(a&b)
2. a+b = a|b + a&b
=> a|b = a^b + a&b


At first, let's prove the statement: GCD(Fn, Fm) = FGCD(n, m).
Let's express Fn + k using Fn and Fk. We'll get the formula: Fn + k = Fk·Fn + 1 + Fk - 1·Fn, which is easy to prove by induction.
Then use the derived formula and notice, that GCD(Fn + k, Fn) = GCD(Fk, Fn).
